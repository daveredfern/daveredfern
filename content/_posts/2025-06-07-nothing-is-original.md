I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to create something original—I think we all do. But, it’s only when I let go of that obsession that something creative happens. The most important part is [Enabling a Chance for Something to Happen](/enabling-a-chance-for-something-to-happen/).

I would highly recommend [reading the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099738-steal-like-an-artist) or watching the [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oww7oB9rjgw) titled “Steal Like An Artist”. It’s great at demonstrating how the most innovative and creative people use other peoples work as a basis for theirs.

The following are some quotes from famous designers and artists.

> The Secret to Creativity Is Knowing How to Hide Your Sources
> *Albert Einstein.*

> Expose yourself to the best things humans have done. And then try and bring those things in to what you’re doing.
> *Steve Jobs*

> Good artists copy, great artists steal.
> *Pablo Picasso*

In an interview by Cameron Crowe, David Bowie was asked: “Since you put yourself first, do you consider yourself an original thinker?”

His response was:

> Not by any means. More like a tasteful thief. The only art I’ll ever study is stuff that I can steal from. I do think that my plagiarism is effective. Why does an artist create, anyway? The way I see it, if you’re an inventor, you invent something that you hope people can use. I want art to be just as practical.
