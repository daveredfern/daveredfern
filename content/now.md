title: "What I'm doing now"
---

I am currently focusing my efforts on:

**Continuously improving this website** with the goals of making it as lean, fast, and user-friendly as possible. If you have any suggestions for improving it, [let me know](/contact/).

**Working at Conversion Rate Expert** as head of design and development. CRE is the world’s leading agency for conversion rate optimization (CRO)—a term they coined in 2007.

**Learning to make bread.** Spending more time at home has encouraged me to learn how to make bread. It’s a really satisfying hobby.

**Learning the piano.** After a 10 year hiatus, I’ve decided to learn the piano again. I’m aiming for one new song a month.

I have a [uses page](/uses/) if you’d like to see what hardware and software I use on a daily basis.

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) via [Marc Jenkins’ now page](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/now/).
