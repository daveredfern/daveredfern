<p class="lead"><strong>This website collects as little personal information as possible.</strong> I don’t know who you are, where you’re from or how you found me.</p>

For security reasons, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), my hosting provider, collects your IP address, user agent, and URL requested. This information is stored for 30 days before being deleted.

I anonymously collect data using [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZIAIFM) to help me improve my website and deliver better content.

On a few pages I embed services like [YouTube](https://youtube.com) and [Speaker Deck](https://www.speakerdeck.com). Those services may collect information about you and use cookies. For more information, see their own privacy notices.
