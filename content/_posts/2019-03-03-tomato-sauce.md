## Ingredients

Makes enough for two medium sized pizzas or pasta for two people.  

- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp organo
- 1 tsp basil
- 3 crushed garlic cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- lots of salt and pepper

## Method

1. Add all the ingredients to a small pan.
2. Turn to medium heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, add the lid and turn the heat too low. Cook for 10 minutes.
3. After 10 minutes, take the lid off and cook to the right consistency. For a pasta sauce, an extra few minutes works well, for pizza paste, an extra 10 minutes works well. If you feel you’ve reduced it too much, just add a splash of water.
4. If you wish to have a smooth texture, blend using a hand blender.

## Tips

- Fresh ingredients always taste better but for convenience I normally use dried ones.
