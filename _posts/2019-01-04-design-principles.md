- **Simplicity:** The best code is no code at all. Only create new things if absolutely necessary. Always look back to see what can be reused or improve upon first.
- **Content first:** Good design is invisible. It should allow someone to consume the content with ease and without imposing itself on the user.
- **Future proof:** Create a design system that is lasting. Easily managed in the future and easy for someone new to use.
