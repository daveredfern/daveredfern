<p class="lead">My aim is to become carbon neutral or climate positive as quickly as possible.</p>

## What I’m doing well

- **🥦 Plant based, whole food diet.** I’ve been vegan since March 2018 and haven’t looked back. If you’re interested, you can see some of [my recipes here](https://daveredfern.com/tag/vegan/). 
- **⚡️Renewable electric.** All of the electricity we use at home is from renewable sources.
- **🍅 Growing my own veg.** I’ve started growing my own vegetables. Since it’s my first year, I’m growing a wide variety of herbs, fruit, and vegetables. 
- **🌳 Offsetting the rest.** While some consider it controversial, I think it’s a great intermediate step before I make the remaining changes. Even then, I’ll like continue to do this so I can be climate positive.

## What I need to improve

- **⛽️ Gas supply.** My gas supply is currently offset. From some quick research, the only vegan energy supplier for gas is [Ecotricity](https://www.ecotricity.co.uk) which I plan to move to once the cost is lower (it’s currently around 30% more than competitors).
- **🚗 Buy locally.** Unfortunately, I don’t buy much locally. After researching, I discovered this is harder than first expected. Most fruit and veg stores don’t source a lot of their products locally so it doesn’t feel like a big gain compared to using Ocado.
- **✈️ Reduce travel or at least offset it.** I’ve not done much travel recently (for obvious reasons), but I plan to be more consciously aware in the future. 
- **🎁 Buy less things.** This is a simple one, buy higher quality items and use them for longer. I love the UKPersonalFinance’s [Should I Buy This?[(https://ukpersonal.finance/spending/) article.
- **💻 Improve my digital footprint (Internet service provider, cell phone network, hosting providers, domain registrar, etc).** Unfortunately, I haven’t paid much attention here. Netlify, my hosting provider, has a [sustainability page](https://www.netlify.com/sustainability/). I’m researching other providers I use.
