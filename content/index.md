I'm Head of Design & Development at [Conversion Rate Experts](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/). I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade's worth of experience designing, developing, and optimizing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

> I have worked in the digital field for more than 10 years and can honestly say that **Dave is one of the best designers I have worked with**. He has a passion for user centred design and a focus and competence to translate his ideas into fully functioning, accessible user interfaces.

## How my website works

In an effort to publish as much as possible, my website [contains articles](/blog/) on everything I find interesting from web design to music and cooking.

Some articles are short. Some articles are incomplete. I’m trying to follow the rule that if it doesn’t contain any private information—for better or worse—I should publish it.

If you’d like to stay up-to-date, I’d love for you to join my [monthly newsletter](/newsletter/).
