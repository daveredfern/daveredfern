<p class="lead">I’m Head of Design & Development at <a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/">Conversion Rate Experts</a>. I work with some of the world’s most sophisticated companies, helping to design and develop user‑centered experiences that deliver measurable returns.</p>

I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade’s worth of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

I am a keen photographer. My photos have been [viewed over 12 million times](https://unsplash.com/daveredfern) and used by Adobe, Squarespace, Trello and Wix.

[Here's what I'm currently focused on](/now/).

While looking through old photos I found this one of me using a computer and had to include it on this page!
