title: "What I’m doing now"
---

I am currently focusing my efforts on:

**Spending my money with the [right people](/supports/).** I’m making a conscious effort to spend my money with those who follow a good ethos and ethics.

**[Intermittent fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting)** using the 16/8 method where I fast for 16 hours a day and eat for 8 hours a day. Once I’ve figured it all out, I’ll write something up. 

**Continuously improving this website** with the goals of making it lean, fast, and user-friendly. If you have any suggestions for improving it, [let me know](/contact/).

**Working at Conversion Rate Expert** as head of design and development. CRE is the world’s leading agency for conversion rate optimization (CRO)—a term they coined in 2007.

**Learning the piano.** After a 10 year hiatus, I’ve decided to learn the piano again.

I have a [uses page](/uses/) if you’d like to see the hardware and software I use on a daily basis.

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) via [Marc Jenkins’ now page](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/now/).
