I recently came across [Andy Matuschak’s working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). It’s a goldmind. One note that caught my eye was [**Work with the garage door up**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu).

> …it’s giving a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. It’s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette.

I’m lucky to be surrounded by some of the [world’s best copywriters](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/). It’s the highlight of my week to screenshare and watch them write. Learning from the end product is difficult but seeing how that end product came to exist—the process—provides a wealth of insights.

Remember to think outload, talk through issues, ask for feedback often, itterate quickly and **work with the garage door up.**
