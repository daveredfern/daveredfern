- **Simplicity:** The best code is no code at all. Only create new things if absolutely necessary. Always look back to see what can be reused or improve upon first.
- **Content first:** Good design is invisible. It should allow someone to consume the content with ease and without imposing itself on the user.
- **Future proof:** Create a design system that is lasting. Easily managed in the future and easy for someone new to use.

The following is a list of design principles I really like:

- [Dieter Rams “Good design” principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#%22Good_design%22_principles)
- [Tim Berners-Lee’s design principles](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html)
- [Digital.gov design principles](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/)
