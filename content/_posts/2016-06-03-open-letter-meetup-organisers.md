I’ve been organising [Staffs Web Meetup](https://staffswebmeetup.co.uk/) for just over 18 months. It’s one of the most rewarding and stressful things I have done in my career.

A few months ago I was speaking with [Phil Wylie](https://twitter.com/mustardbees) and [Natasha Allsopp](https://twitter.com/natasha_allsopp) about how we could make our lives easier. There are lots of meetup groups in the area. We thought it might be good to have a casual meetup of meetup organisers. An opportunity for us to share experiences, knowledge and contacts.

Fast forward to today. We have a [website and mailing list](https://meetupofmeetup.commeetuporganisers.com/). We don’t have a date right now but it will be in Birmingham. We’re hoping it will be a relaxed evening with good company. If successful I'm hoping this can turn into a twice yearly event.

At the moment we’re gauging interest. So if you’re a meetup organiser and interested, have a look! We've setup a ridiculously long website address for it.
