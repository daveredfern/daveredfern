title: "What I'm doing now"

I am currently focusing my efforts on:

**Continuously improving this website** with the goals of making it as lean, fast, and user-friendly as possible. I’ve just moved from WordPress to Jekyll. If you have any suggestions for improving it, [let me know]({{ site.url }}/contact/).

**Working at Conversion Rate Expert** as head of design and development. CRE is the world’s leading agency for conversion rate optimization (CRO)—a term they coined in 2007.

**Learning the piano.** After a 10 year hiatus, I’ve decided to learn again. I’m aim for one new song a month.
