I’m Head of Design & Development at [Conversion Rate Experts](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/). I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade’s worth of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

I am a keen photographer. My photos have been viewed over 11 million times and used by Adobe, Squarespace, Trello and Wix.
