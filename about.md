I’m Head of Design & Development at Conversion Rate Experts. I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade’s worth of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

To help teams use modular CSS and best practices I helped create a lightweight front end framework. [Chop Chop](https://github.com/getchopchop/chopchop) is an open source project. It creates a structured environment that combines popular methodologies such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) and [namespaces](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) with technologies such as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

I am founder of [Staffs Web Meetup](https://staffswebmeetup.co.uk/). A monthly meetup hosting talks to a friendly bunch of 50 people. I've also founded [Meetup of Meetup Organisers](https://meetupofmeetup.commeetuporganisers.com/), a meetup for organisers to network and share ideas.

[Here's what I'm currently focused on](https://daveredfern.com/now/).

## About this website

This site is built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). [My goal](https://daveredfern.com/2016/achieving-100-on-google-page-insights-using-wordpress/) is to make it as fast as possible.

It uses a custom theme called [System](https://github.com/daveredfern/system). Why named System? This website uses system fonts. On a Mac or iPhone you’ll see [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), Android you’ll see [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto) and on Windows, you’ll see [Segoe UI](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331). I first saw it at [Ampersand Conference](http://2015.ampersandconf.com/) in 2015 when [Marcin Wichary](http://2015.ampersandconf.com/speakers#marcin) from Medium demonstrated it.

All the code for this theme is on [Github](https://github.com/daveredfern/system). It’s probably not in a state to use on your own website (without some tweaking) but feel free to have a nose around and use what you like.

There are a few WordPress plugins on the site. The ones that help me turbo charge my site are [Autoptimize](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/), [WP Super Cache](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) and [WP Smush](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/). Other plugins that deserve a shout out are [Custom Post Type UI](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/), [Advanced Custom Fields](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/), [BackUpWordPress](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/) and [The SEO Framework](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/).

This site is hosted using [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/bc95a13c0cfa), configured using [Serverpilot](https://www.serverpilot.io/?refcode=aa3599defb04).

## Soppy thanks

A big thanks to [Gareth Joyce](http://garethjoyce.co.uk), [Jake Cobley](https://jakecobley.com), [Marc Jenkins](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/) and [Phil Wylie](https://www.philwylie.co.uk/). Their passion for the web typifies why I love this industry. You should definitely check them out.

The biggest thanks goes to my girlfriend, [Karen Uppal](https://karenuppal.co.uk/). I tinker far too much.
