When in doubt or looking for a starting point, defer to what others have already created. Especially when those systems have been built for everyone and used by millions of people every day.

As the book says, “[Steal Like An Artist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099738-steal-like-an-artist).”

Before reinventing the wheel, the following is a list of places that do great work.

* [Components – GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/)
* [Material Design](https://material.io/design/)

If you know of a place that should be added to the list above, [let me know](/contact/).
