In Interview with Business Week, Apple Steve Jobs said the following:

> Simple can be harder than complex: you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.  

Less words take longer to write, simple code takes many iterations, and [good design](/design-principles/) are born from complex ones. 

The more I solve problems the more I think it’s an unavoidable part of the process. Simplicity on the far side of complexity. 

The process isn’t easy, it’s time consuming, but once you’re on the other side—the simple side—it’s one of the most rewarding feelings.

When do you know you’ve reached the other side? [Buckminster Fuller](https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.107.55/297.bb9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lessons-at-30.pdf) says the following:
 
> When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.
