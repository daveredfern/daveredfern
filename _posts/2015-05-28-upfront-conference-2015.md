This year I was lucky enough to attend the first [UpFront Conference](http://2015.upfrontconf.com/). It was a great day out, full of really entertaining and informative talks. It's probably one of the best conferences I have attended.

On [iWeb's blog I wrote](https://www.iweb.co.uk/2015/05/upfront-conference-2015-responsive-web-design-is-more-than-the-look/) a detailed round up of the day.

> Conferences allow us to look outwards, to recharge our enthusiasm for the web and to inspire us to continue making great things.
> 
> Most of us are naturally inward looking, turning our heads to see what others are doing can be extremely valuable. Both to learn new things and to confirm weâ€™re on the right track.

> This year saw the very first [UpFront Conference](http://2015.upfrontconf.com/). A Manchester-based conference that focuses on front end development. It was probably one of the most interesting and valuable conferences I have been to.
