One of my favorite quotes from the book “[Let My People Go Surfing](https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/product/let-my-people-go-surfing-revised-paperback-book/BK067.html)” is from Patagonia’s first CEO, [Kristine McDivitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Tompkins). Kristine had no experience running a business. She had to learn on the job by asking people for help.

> If you just ask people for help—if you just admit that you don’t know something—they will fall all over themselves trying to help.

One of the best things about the web industry is its community. It’s full of passionate people who are willing to help.

So next time, [Work with the garage door up](/work-with-the-garage-door-up/) and **ask for help**.
