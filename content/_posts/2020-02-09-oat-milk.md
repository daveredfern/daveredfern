Oat milk is expensive to buy but ridiculously easy to make at home. This recipe takes 5 minutes and only uses 4 ingredients. Honestly, it couldn’t be simpler to make your own milk.

Makes 1 liter of oat milk.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of oat milk
- 4 cups of water
- Pinch of sea salt
- 2-3 dates

## Instructions

1. Add all the ingredients into a blender.
2. Blitz for 1 minute until smooth.
3. Using a [muslin cloth](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Colperun-Cheesecloth-Unbleached-Hallowmas-Decorations/dp/B07B6M53FP/), strain the liquid into a bowl. You may wish to do this a couple of times to remove any bits.
4. Add to a bottle to store in the fridge. It will last a few days.

Remember to shake the bottle before using it each time.
