When in doubt or looking for a starting point, defer to what others have already created. Especially when those systems have been built for everyone and used by millions of people every day.

If you like this is stealing, read my article on [nothing is original](/nothing-is-original).

The following is a list of places that do great work:

* [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* [NHS Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)
* [Material Design](https://material.io/design/)

If you know of a place that should be added to the list above, [let me know](/contact/).
