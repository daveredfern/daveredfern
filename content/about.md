<p class="lead">I’m Head of Design & Development at <a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/">Conversion Rate Experts</a>. I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade’s worth of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.</p>

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.
