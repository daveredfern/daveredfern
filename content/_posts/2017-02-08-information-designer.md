I recently heard [Paul Boag](https://boagworld.com/season/17/episode/1702/) speak about information design. I've always struggled to apply a job title that accurately describes what I do. Information Designer is the closest yet.

> The term has come to be used specifically for graphic design for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression.

Many of the ideas of information design align with my beliefs and thoughts into what makes a good website. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_design) has lots of information on the practice of information design.
