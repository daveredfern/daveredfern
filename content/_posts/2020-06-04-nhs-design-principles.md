I’ve previously shared my [design principles](/design-principles/) that I use when I’m designing and building new systems.

The [NHS have shared their own design principles](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/design-principles) and they’re a brilliant example.

It’s reading the page on their website but here is the brief overview of them.

1. Put people at the heart of everything you do
2. Design for the outcome
3. Be inclusive
4. Design for context
5. Design for trust
6. Test your assumptions
7. Make, learn, iterate
8. Do the hard work to make it simple
9. Make things open. It makes things better
