title: "What I'm doing now"

I am currently focusing my efforts on:

**Continuously improving this website** with the goals of making it as lean, fast, and user-friendly as possible. If you have any suggestions for improving it, make sure to [reach out](https://daveredfern.com/contact/).

**Working at Conversion Rate Expert.** We’re currently recruiting for a front-end developer to join our team of world-leading experts, responsible for delivering amazing (and measurable) results for our clients. If you’re interested in finding out more, all the info is on our [careers page](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/careers/).

**Learning the piano, again.** During school, I used to play the piano. After a 10 year hiatus, I’ve decided to pick it up again. It’s surprising how much I remember. I’m really enjoying it and will soon be taking requests! ;-)
