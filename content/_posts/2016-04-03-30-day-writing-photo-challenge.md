I recently signed up to [Marc Jenkins’ 30 day writing challenge](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/the-30-day-writing-challenge/). The challenge involves setting aside some time each day to write during April. There are over 100 people participating, writing articles on their own website or Medium about a variety of topics ranging from the web industry to personal health and even short stories.

## Original goal

I originally set a goal of writing an hour a day and publishing two posts a week. My posts were going to revolve around the web industry, with a particular focus on design and front end development.

Unfortunately, as you can probably see, we are now three days into April and I don’t have anything to show. Writing is hard! I have been successfully writing each day, but unfortunately nothing post worthy has come from it. They either haven’t made the point I was originally aiming for or turned into a meandering ramble.

## Changing my goal

This weekend I went to the second [Visit Birmingham instameet](http://visitbirmingham.com/). Over the past few months I've gone from a holiday snapper to keen amateur photographer. I've been trying to take photos each weekend and publish one a day on my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/daveredfern/).

While editing some photos today I had a light bulb moment – why not write about my photography? I take lots of photos of amazing buildings, objects and locations but never spend the time to learn more about the history behind them.

So, I have decided to change my goal. Starting tomorrow I will be posting everyday. Each post will contain one of my favourite photos with information about the building, object or location featured.

Head over to my [photography section](/photography/) to see my posts.

Wish me luck!
