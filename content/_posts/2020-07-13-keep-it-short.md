Written communication can be time-consuming but it doesn’t need to be. When writing I use the following rules.

1. **Keep it short.** Write a little as possible.
2. **Be explicit and direct.** Being passive can cost you lots of follow-up discussions.
3. **Write for an international audience.** Some words have double which might be offensive or cause you to break rule 2.
4. **If it’s turning into a thread, jump on a call.** It’s the equivalent of days of text-based communication.
5. **Don’t be offended.** People are generally good. Don’t read into tone when communicating with text.
