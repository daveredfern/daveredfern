title: "The charities, companies, and people I support"
---

I’m making a conscious effort to spend my money with those who follow a good ethos and ethics.

The following is a list of charities, companies, and people I support through either buying their products, subscribing to their services, or donating.

## Charities

**[Farm Animal Sanctuary](https://www.thefarmanimalsanctuary.co.uk/)** cares for hundreds of animals who have been saved from slaughter or poorly treated. I help support them by sponsoring their animals and visiting their open days.

**[Bulb Carbon Offsetting](https://bulb.co.uk/carbon-calculator/)** allows me to offset my impact on the plant. I’m currently offsetting my footprint of 5 tonnes. They use the money to protect the Gola rainforest in Sierra Leone, provide clean cookstoves in Ghana and Kenya, and support wind and solar power in India.

## Independent companies

**[Dithering](https://dithering.fm/)** is a podcast by Ben Thompson and John Gruber. It’s 15-minutes an episode, three times a week. It’s really insightful and they both do great work on their respective websites.

**[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZIAIFM)** is a privacy focussed, GDPR friendly alternative to Google Analytics. They’re a two man company striving to provide enough information for website owners to make informed decisions while keeping their users information private.

**[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/)** is a good old RSS reader. It’s simple, reliable, and integrates with lots of other great applications.

**[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)** is a podcast app by Marco Arment. I listen to dozens of podcasts and Marco does a great job with his app… and saved me dozens of hours with his smart speed feature.

## Large companies

**[Bulb energy](www.bulb.me/davidr1004)** is my electricity and gas provider. 100% of their electricity is renewable and their gas is 100% carbon neutral.

**[Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/)** are a clothing brand that focus on creating amazingly design clothes that pay their staff and suppliers well, and look after the environment. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, wrote [Let My People Go Surfing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22155.Let_My_People_Go_Surfing) about the company.
