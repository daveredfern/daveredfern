## Chop Chop

A lightweight front end framework that is in production with several projects at work. It's goal is to create a standardised way of developing websites so projects become developer agnostic. It's available on Github so feel free to use it all or just bits. We have a monthly release schedule so keep an eye on developments.

## Homebrew Website Club

[Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) meetups take place [online](https://indieweb.org/IRC) and [around the world](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Meetings) every other Wednesday. Passionate people gather to work on their own websites and discuss the future of publishing on the web in the same structure as the classic [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) meetings.

See more information on the [Birmingham Homebrew Website Club...website](https://homebrewbrum.co.uk/).

## Meetup of meetup organisers

Founder and organiser of a semi-regular meetup of meetup organisers.  The aim is for each meetup to be an informal gathering to share ideas, problems, successes, and contacts. Generally, a drink (or two) and some tasty grub doesn't go amiss either.

## System

A WordPress theme for this website. The goals of the theme are to be as fast as possible. The name system comes from the font stack that was inspired by Medium. It uses the default system font of the platform the visitor is browsing from.
