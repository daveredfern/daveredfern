My aim is to become carbon neutral or climate positive as quickly as possible.

## What I’m doing well

- **🥦 Plant based, whole food diet.** I’ve been vegan since March 2018 and haven’t looked back. If you’re interested, you can see some of [my recipes here](https://daveredfern.com/tag/vegan/). 
- **⚡️Renewable electric.** All of the electricity we use at home is from renewable sources.
- **🍀 Offsetting the rest.** While some consider it controversial, I think it’s a great intermediate step before I make the remaining changes. Even then, I’ll like continue to do this so I can be climate positive.

## What I need to improve

⛽️ Gas supply

🚗 Buying locally

✈️ Travel

🎁 Buy less things
