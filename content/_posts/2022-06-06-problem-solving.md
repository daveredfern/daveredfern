Not all problems are created equal. On any website and in any business there will be an endless list of things that can be improved. Before doing anything, I find Nicholas C. Zakas’ list of five questions helpful for prioritizing if they should be fixed, by who, and how high of a priority it is.

1. Is this really a problem?
2. Does the problem need to be solved?
3. Does the problem need to be solved now?
4. Does the problem need to be solved by me?
5. Is there a simpler problem I can solve instead?

> Each question is designed to reveal something about the problem that allows you to go to the next step, or if you’re lucky, just avoid the problem altogether.

Nicolas has a detailed article called [How I think about solving problems](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2020/02/how-i-think-about-solving-problems/) that’s well worth a read. It contains some nuance to each question which is helpful to understand.
