I'm currently watching [Abstract: The Art of Design](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883) on Netflix. It's a wonderful insight into how the best designers create iconic work. Part of what makes it wonderful is sharing the struggle of design that we've all experienced.

Here is a quote from the first episode that features Illustrator [Christoph Niemann](http://www.christophniemann.com/).

> So I think Chuck Close said, inspiration is for amateurs, us professionals, we just go to work in the morning.
> 
> The one thing I really love about that quote is it relieves you of a lot of pressure. It’s not about waiting for hours for this moment where inspiration strikes.
> 
> It’s just about showing up and getting started and then something amazing happens or it doesn’t happen. All that matters is you enabled a chance for something to happen.
