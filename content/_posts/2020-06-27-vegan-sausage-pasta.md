This sounds a strange combination but trust me. It’s quick to make (around 15 minutes), can be made in large batches, and a crowd pleaser for the whole family.

The following recipe makes one portion but it’s really easy to multiply up.

## Ingredients

* 2 vegan chorizo sausages (I like the [Linda McCartney ones](https://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/our-food/frozen-range/vegetarian-chorizo-red-pepper-sausages/))
* 80g of your favorite dried pasta
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika
* Handful of fresh tomatoes chopped into chunks (I like cherry tomatoes halved)
* Salt and pepper
* Small handful of basil.

## Method
1. Pre-heat the oven and cook the sausages following the instructions on the package.
2. Heat a large pan with water salt.
3. Cook the pasta following the instructions on the packet. You’ll need to calculate the timings so the pasta is cooked 3-4 minutes before the sausages are.
4. While the pasta is cooking, chop the tomatoes and chop the basil.
5. Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water, keeping a few tablespoons of the liquid.
6. Turn off the heat on the stove or set it to the lowest setting. Add the pasta back into the pan along with the water you saved and all the other ingredients apart from the sausages (which are still in the oven).
7. Stir the pasta until all the ingredients have mixed well. Once everything is mixed together, take the sausages out of the oven, chop them into small chunks and stir into the pasta.
8. Serve in a bowl. Optionally, sprinkle with some chopped basil. Adding basil really freshens the dish up.

## Tips and tricks

* You’re aiming to have the pasta and sausages finish roughly at the same time. You might not get it perfect and that’s not to worry. You can reheat the sausages in the pasta dish or continue to keep the pasta on low heat while the sausages finish. The longer the pasta mix is on the heat the more dry it will become so you may need to add an extra tablespoon or two of water.
* Experiment with different types of vegan sausages. There are a huge variety and it really changes the flavor of the dish.
