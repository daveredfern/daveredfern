This week I wrote an article on the iWeb blog about [performance driven web design](https://www.iweb.co.uk/2016/09/performance-driven-web-design/). This is a more in-depth of an article I wrote a few weeks ago on this blog called [Speed is design](https://daveredfern.com/2016/speed-is-design/). In the article I go into depth about why companies should care about speed and how there are multiple reasons for a poorly performing website that crosses multiple disciplines.

Spoiler alert: Team work is vital.

> A fast website requires a team effort where performance is put at the forefront of all decisions. Every feature or designed element has a cost to performance. It’s a balancing act between features, design and performance. As a team, we need to weigh up the pros and cons of each element and decide whether it’s inclusion outweighs the cost to performance.

> A good example is carousels. Carousels have a huge cost to performance. They are large to download (with multiple images and JavaScript) and can take a lot of processing power to animate. The cost of a carousel is high but the [impact is very low](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/). Studies have shown that only 1% of users click the featured banner with 90% of those clicks being the first image. That means that the other banners are only clicked 0.1% of the time.
