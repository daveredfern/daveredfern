Chesterton’s fence is the principle that something should not be changed or removed until you fully understand why it existed in the first place.

> The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”  

It’s a principle that [Wikipedia have adopted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) in their policy to change or delete content. If you nominate a change, as part of your request, you must first acknowledge and understand why it existed in the first place and why it should be removed.

In summary, things exist for a reason. No matter how good or bad it is, delete or change with caution and only when you fully understand why it existed in the first place.
