It's took a while, but it finally feels like CSS has matured to what it originally promised.

Gone are the days of [clearfixes](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) and floats, let alone [transparent PNG fixes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/png-hack-for-ie-6/) and weird browser specific selectors! Remember having to use a \* at the beginning of selectors to target IE6 and below? If you’re in a reminiscent mood, [here are some more](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/browser-specific-hacks/).

We often hear the phrase ‘good old days’. I am glad the good old days are behind us! Good riddance! I'm not a religious person, so to reference something from the Bible it has to be good! [Ecclesiastes 7:10](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.html):

> Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions.

Hello to a new era of CSS. It finally feels like it caters for our needs. The introduction of [CSS calc](/2015/06/css-calc-is-more-supported-than-media-queries/), [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), [nth child](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp), just to name a few, are revealing the power of CSS and flexible layouts.

[Responsive web design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) is what the web should have always been. Instead of mimicking other industries such as print, we're now able to stand proud on our own two feet and innovate for a better web.

Internet Explorer is no longer a special case where we have to support several versions. Thanks to the introduction of other options, Internet Explorer's majority has diluted down to a [mediocre 12%](http://caniuse.com/usage-table), and that’s only if you include IE7 and IE8.

We often moan about the [number](http://www.google.com/chrome/) [of](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) [browsers](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) [on](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/download-ie) [the](http://www.opera.com/) [market](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/) but it’s created a level playing field. For the most part they all behave the same. It’s forced browsers to keep up-to-date and include the new CSS features we've all been craving for. We can now focus on creating a better browsing experience instead of supporting quirky browsers.

The real web's pretty awesome. I love real CSS.
