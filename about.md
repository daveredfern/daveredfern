I’m Head of Design & Development at Conversion Rate Experts. I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade’s worth of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

To help teams use modular CSS and best practices I helped create a lightweight front end framework. [Chop Chop](https://github.com/getchopchop/chopchop) is an open source project. It creates a structured environment that combines popular methodologies such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) and [namespaces](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) with technologies such as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

I am a keen photographer. My photos have been viewed over 11 million times and used by Adobe, Squarespace, Trello and Wix.

I am founder of [Staffs Web Meetup](https://staffswebmeetup.co.uk/). A monthly meetup hosting talks to a friendly bunch of 50 people. I've also founded [Meetup of Meetup Organisers](https://meetupofmeetup.commeetuporganisers.com/), a meetup for organisers to network and share ideas.
