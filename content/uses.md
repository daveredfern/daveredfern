The following is a list of everything I use.

I generally recommend everything in the list. I wouldn’t use them if I didn’t. That being said, there are a few products that are the best I’ve found but I still don’t particularly enjoy them. For those, I’ve made a note.

## Hardware {#hardware}

I use a [MacBook Pro 15”](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_GB), [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english), and [Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ2R2Z/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver). I previously used a [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA02Z/A/magic-mouse-2-silver) (and I still own one) but it was causing some aches in my hand so switched to the trackpad which fixed it.

When I’m at home, I use an [Ergotron Stand Workstation](https://www.ergotron.com/en-gb/products/product-details/33-342) with an [LG Apple Display](https://www.apple.com/uk-business/shop/product/HMUB2B/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display). When listening to music, I use [Bower & Wikins P7 headphones](https://www.whathifi.com/bw/p7/review). Everything is connected to a [Belkin Surge Protection Extension Lead Strip](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OE4510M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

While working remotely, I use a [Roost laptop stand](https://www.therooststand.com/). I store the keyboard and trackpad in a [carry sleeve](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01GFLRZDW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is all stored inside of a The North Face backpack. The North Face don’t sell my backpack anymore but the [Borealis Classic Backpack](https://www.thenorthface.co.uk/shop/en-gb/tnf-gb/borealis-classic-backpack-cf9c) is the closest looking model.

I use a [iPhone Xs](apple.com/uk/newsroom/2018/09/iphone-xs-and-iphone-xs-max-bring-the-best-and-biggest-displays-to-iphone/) and never leave home without my [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods/).

## Software {#software}

On my Mac, I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) for music, [Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/reminders/welcome/mac) for… reminders, [Bear](https://bear.app/) for note taking, and [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) for my RSS reader.

While coding, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I previously used [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet), [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/), [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)) but more recently, I’ve slim down my app usage. They’re all good pieces of software so I’m keeping them here as honorary mentions.

I also use a few utility apps. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for search, snippets, and a clipboard manager. [1Password](https://1password.com/) for a password manager. [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/) for observing my productivity. [ColorSnapper 2](https://colorsnapper.com/) for grabbing color references.

On my iPhone, I use a lot of the same apps as my Mac (1Password, Reminders, Bear, Spotify, NetNewsWire, etc). In addition, I also use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) for podcasts, and [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph1fbef4daa/ios) instead of Chrome.

I subscribe to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) which helps sync my RSS subscriptions between devices. I’m a big [Google Suite](https://gsuite.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/) user so use Gmail, Calendar, and Drive constantly. 

## This website {#website}

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The forms are managed and processed by [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/). I collect analytics anonymously using [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). Almost all of the images are hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

For more information, you can [see my style guide](/style-guide/).

## Photography {#photography}

I have an [Olympus OM-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-10) and [Olympus OM-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-2). I almost always use either a 28mm or 50mm lens. When I’m feeing wealthy, I use [Kodak Portra 400](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FNRTGG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and for all the other times, I use [Fujifilm Superia 200](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/your-account/order-history/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search?opt=ab&search=film). I get my film processed at [AG Photo Lab](https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/).

## Music {#music}

I play the piano. I use a [Roland FP-30](https://www.roland.com/uk/products/fp_series/fp-30/) with official stand and pedals. I’m also experimenting with a [Novation Launchkey Mini MK3](https://novationmusic.com/en/keys/launchkey-mini).

I’ve not settled on any particular software but my go to are [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac/garageband/).

## Kitchen {#kitchen}

I love cooking. For how much I love cooking, I only have a handful of recommendations. My go to place is Ikea and Oxo. They both fantastic value equipment.

I spent far too long buying non-stick pots and pans before I discovered stainless steel. There is no looking back now. The [Ikea Sensuell 4-piece cookware set](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/sensuell-4-piece-cookware-set-stainless-steel-grey-20324541/) are probably my most loved piece of equipment in the kitchen. I did lots of research before buying these are for value-for-money, nothing else comes close. I also like the Ikea stainless steel [Koncis](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/search/products/?q=KONCIS) range. They cheap and last forever.

The [Oxo Good Grips 2 Piece Cutting Board Set](https://www.oxouk.com/products/preparing/peelers-choppers/2-piece-cutting-board-set) are awesome chopping boards. They don’t slip, last for changes, and don’t blunt my knives. The only downside is the large one is slightly too big for a dishwasher.

I often have smoothies for breakfast. To make them I use a [Nurtibullet Pro](https://www.nutribullet.com/shop/blenders/nutribullet-pro/). It’s a little noisy so you might want to have a look at the [Nutribullet 600](https://www.nutribullet.com/shop/blenders/nutribullet/).

The [Kenwood Triblade Hand Blender](https://www.kenwoodworld.com/uk/products/blenders/hand-blenders/triblade-hand-blender-hdp406wh-0w22111014) is ridiculously useful. It saves transferring food from the pot to a blender, is quick, powerful, and dishwasher friendly.

Lastly, the [Oxo Good Grips Salad Spinner](https://www.oxouk.com/products/preparing/fruit-vegetable-tools/salad-spinner-1340) has been a great purchase. I can’t believe how long I spend washing salad by hand. This makes it easy and quick to use.
