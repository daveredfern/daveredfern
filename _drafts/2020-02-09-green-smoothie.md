This is a super fresh smoothie to kick start your day. It’s inspired by the smoothies that Joe Rogan and Rich Roll have in the mornings. If you’ve never had a green smoothie for breakfast, this one is will worth a try—it’ll make you feel fresh and ready to go for the rest of the day!

Makes one full smoothie using a standard NutriBullet cup (900ml or 32oz.)

## Ingredients

- 4cm length of cucumber
- Large handful kale
- 2cm chunk of ginger
- 1 apple
- 1 trimmed celery stick
- 1 kiwi
- 1 heaped teaspoon of coconut oil
- 1-2 cup of water (around 250-400ml)
- (Optional) 1 teaspoon of chia seeds
- (Optional) 1 teaspoon of flaxseeds/linseeds
- (Optional) 1 teaspoon of matcha powder

## Instructions

1. Cut the ginger, apple, celery sticks and cucumber into smaller chunks.
2. Peal the kiwi and cut into smaller chunks.
3. Add all the ingredients to a NutriBullet cup or blender. Any container that can make around 900ml of smoothie will work.
