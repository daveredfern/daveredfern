I own an iPad Pro 12.9". 

## Good

- Codespaces on iPad
  - Works better than expected.
  - Some font issues.
  - Shortcuts are a bit all over the place. For example, copy and paste shortcuts donâ€™t seem to work.

## Bad

- No way to preview right now locally. Could use branches to created a dev site.
- Display size. It would be nice if instead of standard and zoom, there was a smaller one too to fit a little more on the screen. Not a biggy through.
