I'm Head of Design & Development atÂ [Conversion Rate Experts](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/). Iâ€™ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade's worth of experience designing, developing, and optimizing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time Iâ€™ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.

## How my website works

In an effort to publish as much as possible, my website [contains articles](/blog/) on everything I find interesting from web design to music and cooking.

Some articles are short. Some articles are incomplete. Iâ€™m trying to follow the rule that if it doesnâ€™t contain any private informationâ€”for better or worseâ€”I should publish it.
