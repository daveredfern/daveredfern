Someone at work said the following:

> Consume vegetables, not candy

I love the concept of avoiding instant gratification and investing as much time as possible in quality content and doing meaningful things. 

Read books, not Twitter.
Listen to albums, not singles.
Watch movies, not YouTube.
Consume vegetables, not candy.
