Written communication can be time-consuming but it doesn’t need to be. When writing I use the following rules.

1. **Keep it short.** Less is more.
2. **Be explicit.** Being passive can create lots of follow-up.
3. **Write for an international audience.** Words can have double meaning that could offend or cause you to break rule two.
4. **Don’t be offended.** Don’t read into tone. People are generally good.
5. **If it’s turning into a thread, jump on a call.** It’s the equivalent of days worth of text-based communication.
