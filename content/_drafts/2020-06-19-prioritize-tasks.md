I use the following three criteria to prioritize tasks and ideas should be completed next.

1. **Ease of implementation.** Is it quick-and-easy to implement or could it potentially take a large amount of time?
2. **Ease of maintenance.** Does it require on-going maintenance? I generally don’t want to implement something that will consume my time in the future.
3. **Impact to the website.** Will it have a big impact on the website? Normally, you can measure this using your [Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC)](/overall-evaluation-criterion/) or key performance indicators (KPI’s).

Each is marked out of 10. The higher the number, the easier to maintain or the higher impact it will have.

Once scored, multiply them together:

**Priority =**<br />
**Ease of implementation × Ease of maintenance × Impact to the website**

For example, on a Shopify website you may have a task to add Apple Pay to the checkout. The ease of implementation is high because it won’t take long to add so we mark it 9/10. It will require almost no future maintenance so we can mark this 9/10. The potential impact to the website is high because for mobile devices, it makes the checkout process one-click so we mark that 8/10.

In that example, the priority score is 648 = 9 × 9 × 8.

Add the calculation to the start of each [to-do or roadmap item](/roadmap/) as a helpful reminder. The higher the number, the higher priority the task should have.

The formula works well for bubbling the lowest hanging fruit to the top of the list. It’s not perfect. It’s often hard to calculate the future impact of a task or idea (you may wish to run some user research or an A/B test to validate the idea).
