In the eyes of a purist this might be cheating. If you're about to design a logo buy this book!

[Logo Modernism (Design)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logo-Modernism-Design-Jens-Muller/dp/3836545306/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486456531&sr=8-1&keywords=logo+modernism) by Jens Muller, R. Roger Remington is around £30 on Amazon and contains hundreds of logos from the 60s, 70s and 80s. It's huge! It's around 450 pages and nearly A3 in size. It's split into various categories such as single letters, multiple letters, typography and geometric.

It's great starting point for a new project, especially if you design logos or icons. If you don't, buy it anyway, it's a fascinating book and definitely deserves a place on your coffee table.
