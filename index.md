I'm Head of Design & Development at [Conversion Rate Experts](http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/). I’ve got a degree in Computer Science and over a decade's worth of experience designing, developing, and optimizing e-commerce websites for leading B2B and B2C businesses.

During this time I’ve worked on nearly all aspects of creating a successful website including wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and performance driven front-end development.
